# LethalIntelligence

This is a mod built upon Piggy's "MaskedAiRevamp v0.2.1" (https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Piggy/MaskedAIRevamp/) with the aim of furthering the work on Masked AI, as well as other AI in the game to make the enemies more interesting or fun to play against.

The aim is a mod, that can tweak all AI, or none (configurable?) that is compatible with popular relative mods, and is an AIO solution for AI Improvement.

The Initial version (0.0.1) is literally a slight re-write of Piggy's Masked AI Revamp v0.2.1 (https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Piggy/MaskedAIRevamp/) as using the decompiled source, the plugin would not compile. As far as i can tell, everything still works as originally it did.

Version 0.0.2 and onwards will be essentially a fork and expansion away from Piggy's original mod, I just figured it would be respectful to provide the original starting point as the first version as sadly I cannot fork Piggy's github as it is not public.

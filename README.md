# LethalIntelligence

## Information

A mod aiming to tweak all AI in the game to have improved flavour and perhaps be more intelligent

This mod is built upon Piggy's "MaskedAiRevamp v0.2.1" (https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Piggy/MaskedAIRevamp/).

As piggy wrote in the readme for v0.2.1 - this mod maybe very buggy, i hope to make it more stable over time!

All clients must have this mod installed for it to work!

There is compatibility with RugbugRedfern's SkinWalkers mod.

The current version is a **very very early** version, no optimization work has been done, so you may experience significant frame drops even with high PC specs!!!

*Also... There may be tons of bugs.* (please do report them to me, either via github or the Lethal Company Modding Community on discord!)

<details>
  <summary>Behaviour (spoiler?):</summary>

* Aggressive
    * If you have a dropped shotgun, pick it up and shoot people.
    * If there is a player with a shotgun, attack with a shovel type item.

* Stealthy
    * No major features yet..

* Cunning
    * Hiding items in bushes (currently 1 - planned to fill all bushes with items)
    * Call a fake dropship using the terminal

* Deceiving
    * Use terminal code

* Insane
    * Use signal translator

 </details>

## Known Issues
- sometimes masked have issues with picking up items (possibly fixed)
- masked sometimes seem a bit confused after leaving the terminal (they need to be given some direction, will fix later)
- masked have aimbot (beleive fixed in 0.0.6)
- slow running issue (beleive fixed in 0.0.6)

## Mods
Recommended to install with this mod:

+ 'MaskedEnemyOverhaulFork' mod by Coppertiel (the original by HomelessGinger is bugged at time of writing this).
+ 'Skinwalkers' by RedbugRedfern. OR 'Mirage' by qwbarch (no integration for mirage as of yet, but it is planned)
